### Create a page with the following elements

1. Create a page having just one box.

2. The box has some width, height, padding, border, and margin.

3. Also, apply the outline around the box.

4. Create a solid border around the box using a box-shadow.

5. The color of the background, border, outline, and the border created using box-shadow should be different.

- Note: There should not be an expansion in the size of the box after applying padding and border.

- Using CSS resets is necessary.
- Use semantic tags and keep the nesting and indentation proper.
